        <h2> Distributed Ledger Technology</h2>
        <p> Distributed Ledger Technology is a data storage mechanism in which data is stored at multiple locations on a shared network. It provides a transparent and secure method of exchnaging money. 
            It uses cryptography to securely store information. A decentralised ledger is immune to a cyber-attack, as all the copies across the network are spread globally, and they need to be attacked simultaneously for the attack to be successful.
        </p>
        <h3> Advantages of DLT </h3>
        <p> Security - Distributed ledgers are safe, as they are decentralised and use high tech security. Nodes that enter malicious data will get expelled from the network </p>
        <p> Transparency - All participants can view every transaction</p>
        <p> Real life application - DLT can help governments with tax collection and the issuance of passports</p>
        </p>
        <h3> Disadvantages of DLT </h3>
        <p> High energy consumption - DLT requires a high amount of computer power to complete signature verification</p>
        <p> Scalability issues - High transaction costs and low speeds are hard to work with on a major scale</p>
        <p> Cost - It can be expensive to complete a transaction</p>
