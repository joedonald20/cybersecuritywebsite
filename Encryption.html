        <h2> Encryption </h2>
        <p> Encryption is the process of securing digital data using mathematical techniques with the use of a key. Encryption is a method of changing data so only approved visitors can access information.
            Businesses may encrypt data in storage for privacy reasons. One of the most common types of encryption is hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS). 
            Encryption converts data from plaintext into ciphertext, plaintext is readbale whereas ciphertext is unreadable.
        </p>
        <h3> Advantages of Encryption </h3>
        <p> Security - Encryption can prevent data breaches during storage </p>
        <p> Privacy - Encryption only allows verified access to encrypted data. This ensures only intended recipients have access to the data </p>
        <p> Integrity - Encryption can help against data manipulating attacks during transfer. Data manipulators may delete or copy files during transfer</p>
        <p> Stability - Encryption can help stabilise an internet connection and prevent packet loss</p>
        <h3> Disadvantages of Encryption </h3>
        <p> Loss of data - Encryption requires keys, losing the keys to the encryption will cause data to be lost</p>
        <p> Restriction Issues - Encryption restricts users access to sensitive information, but it also makes it challenging for the data owner to access the information</p>
